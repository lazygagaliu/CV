		<div class="itd">Hey guys, I am Gaga Liu. Over my past 30 years, I have tried a lot of things. I am an aries with inexhaustible passion and curiosity so I've always wanna go for something I want or to be someone I want to be. I understand there are some people would say that it's not really reliable if you change your goal constantly just because I tried multiple things in my past. I would say I like my life to be fresh all the time instead of keeping changing the goal. In fact, I think I never changed my goal in my entire life. I always believe there is a reason that God made us have emotions. We can see, listen, smell, touch and taste, just feel everything in the world with our own heart. All the feelings can make us happy, angry or even sad. So I would say my goal of my life is always to experience as much as I can as long as I am alive.</div>
		<div class="itd">I wouldn't say I was the top in the areas I've touched before. But I am confident to tell you that I committed to pour my whole heart in who I want to be.</div>
		<div class="itd">So here we are! I really want to be a Front-End Engineer in the near future. I will work so damn hard on it and also try to get over all the obstacles.</div>
